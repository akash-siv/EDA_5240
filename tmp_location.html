One night a young man was driving along Mays Canyon Road when he thought he spotted a woman standing in the middle of the road. She appeared suddenly; at first he believed he'd hit her, but later realized he'd passed through her figure with his vehicle. Not long after -- perhaps a few months -- a girl (who had no knowledge of the previous sighting) was walking along the road at twilight when she encountered a woman walking the opposite direction. The woman asked the girl if she knew some of the other boys who took walks down Mays at nighttime, and the girl replied that she did. They chatted briefly and parted ways. Later, it was discovered that her description of the woman matched that of the woman who had been \"run over.\" Because so many people have described dangerous or frightening experiences on Mays Canyon Road, many of the detai ls where chosen to be left out.","Mazama High School Football Field","Mc Culloch county courthouse","McAlpine Creek Park","McCandless Town Hall","McCarthur House","McClurg Mansion","McConnell Airforce Base","McConnell's Mill State Park","McCord","McCorristin Catholic High School","McCorys farm","McCoshish Mill","McCully House","McDevitt middle school","McDonald's","McDonalds on Miramar Rd.","McDow's Hole","McDowell High School","McGee's Tavern: Point Pleasant","McGuire's House","McHenry County","McHenry East High School","McKeesport","McKelligon Canyon","McKinley Elementary School","McKinney Hollow","McKinney Public Library","McKinney downtown.","McKnay Museum","McLaughlin High School","McLaughlin Middle School","McLoughlin house","McMecham road","McMillan hotel","McMinnimises Grand Lodge","McMorran Theater","McNary high school","McNeel Middle School","McPike Mansion","McRaven Tour Home","McWhorter","Mckinley Middle School","Mclintock Park","Mcoy road","Mead Hotel","Mead Middle School","Mead grave yard","Meade Hotel","Meadowbrook","Meadowbrook Cemetery","Meadowside Nature Center","Mears Junction","Mechanics Fire Station#2","Mechanicsville","Mechanists Hall","Medaille College","Medco Center of Pembroke (Nursing Home)","Medicine Bow","Medicine Forest","Medlar View Elementary","Meeteetse","Melodrama Musical Theatre","Melody Inn","Melrose Cemetery","Melrose Elementary School","Melting Pot Restaurant (formerly the town's library)","Memorial Building","Memorial Cemetery","Memorial Community Hospital","Memorial Elementary","Memorial Hall","Memorial Union","Memory Gardens","Memory Grove","Memory Hill Cemetery","Memory Town","Memphis Cemetery","Menasha High School","Mendel Elementary School","Mendham","Menger Hotel","Menominee Casino Bingo and Hotel","Menominee Tribal Police Dept","Menomonee Co Park office","Mental Hospital","Mentor","Merced","Mercer University","Mercur","Mercy Regional Diagnostic Center","Mercywood Hospital","Meridan Ave.","Merrehope","Merrimack College","Merritt island","Mescalero day care center","Messenger Woods Forest Preserve","Metal Museum/Army hospital","Metal factory","Methodist Cemetery","Methodist College","Methuen High School","Metro North Trestle","Metro commons trailer park","Metron nursing home","Metropolitan Ave.","Mettryville","Metz Elementary","Mexican slaughter house","Meyzeek Middle School","Miami Beach","Miami Senior High School","Miami Springs","Miami University, Oxford College","Miami school","Miamisburg","Michael Burke Mansion","Michael Hoyt house","Michelle's School of Dance","Michigan Ave. near Ferry Lane","Michigan Career and Technical Institute","Michigan Center High School- January 2007","Michigan Center Jr. High School","Michigan City","Michigan Island Lighthouse","Michigan Theater","Microdental Laboratories","Microtel Inn and Suites","Mid-Buchanan High School","Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center","Middle Bosque River","Middlesboro Park, near Greenwood Rd.","Middlesbrough","Middleton Tavern","Middletown","Midland Cemetery","Midland Cinemas","Midland Lutheran College","Midnight Adult Books","Midtown Cafe","Midway Baptist Church","Midway Recreation Center","Midwest City High School Performing Arts Center","Mifflin County","Mifflin Elementary School","Mighty Taco on Eggert Street","Mike's York Street Bar &amp;
